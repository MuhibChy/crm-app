## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this CRM application, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: [your-security-email@domain.com]
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication
- CSRF token protection on all forms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- Prepared statements for SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection with proper output escaping
- Secure password hashing (Argon2ID)

### Infrastructure Security
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- File access restrictions via .htaccess
- Sensitive file exclusion (.env, logs, etc.)
- HTTPS enforcement (recommended)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   ```bash
   # Always check before committing
   git diff --cached
   
   # Use git-secrets to prevent accidental commits
   git secrets --scan
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   ```php
   // Always validate and sanitize input
   $email = filter_var($_POST['email'], FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
   $id = filter_var($_POST['id'], FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
   ```

3. **Output Escaping**
   ```php
   // Always escape output
   echo htmlspecialchars($userInput, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
   ```

4. **Database Queries**
   ```php
   // Always use prepared statements
   $stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
   $stmt->bind_param('i', $userId);
   ```

### For Administrators

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Keep PHP and web server updated
   - Disable unnecessary PHP functions
   - Configure proper file permissions
   - Enable security headers

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Create dedicated database users
   - Limit database privileges
   - Regular backups

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor security logs
   - Set up intrusion detection
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor for unusual activity

## Common Vulnerabilities & Mitigations

### SQL Injection
**Risk**: High
**Mitigation**: 
- All database queries use prepared statements
- Input validation on all parameters
- Principle of least privilege for database users

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- All output is properly escaped
- Content Security Policy headers
- Input validation and sanitization

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Risk**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- CSRF tokens on all forms
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Referrer validation

### File Upload Vulnerabilities
**Risk**: High
**Mitigation**:
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Secure file storage
- Virus scanning (recommended)

### Session Hijacking
**Risk**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Secure session configuration
- HTTPS enforcement
- Session regeneration
- Proper session timeout

## Security Configuration

### PHP Security Settings
```php
// Recommended php.ini settings
expose_php = Off
display_errors = Off
log_errors = On
session.cookie_secure = 1
session.cookie_httponly = 1
session.use_strict_mode = 1
```

### Apache Security Headers
```apache
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
```

### MySQL Security
```sql
-- Remove test databases
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS test;

-- Create dedicated user
CREATE USER 'crm_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON crm_db.* TO 'crm_user'@'localhost';

-- Remove anonymous users
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
```

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach

   - Monitor for further activity
   - Communicate with stakeholders

4. **Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Test all systems
   - Resume normal operations

5. **Lessons Learned**
   - Document what happened
   - Update security procedures
   - Improve monitoring
   - Train team members
